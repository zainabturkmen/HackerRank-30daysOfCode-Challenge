// Day 4: Class vs. Instance

/* 
 Write a Person class with an instance variable,age, and 
 a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge as a parameter. 
 The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the 
 argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is 
 passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not 
 valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance 
 methods: yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1. 
 amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions: 
 If age < 13, print You are young. If  age > and equal 13 and 
 age <18, print You are a teenager..Otherwise, print You are old..
