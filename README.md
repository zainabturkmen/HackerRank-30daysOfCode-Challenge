# HackerRank 30 Days Of Code Challenge
  

### Day 1: Data Types
#### For solving the first challenge I used JavaScript. But whatever language that you want you can use and solve it.   
  

 
### Day 2: Operators 
#### Task: Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer. For solving the problem I used JS as day 1.
 


### Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements
#### /* Task Given an integer,N, perform the following conditional actions: If N is odd, print Weird If N is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird If N is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird If N is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.



### Day 4: Class vs. Instance
#### Write a Person class with an instance variable,age, and a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods: yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions: If age < 13, print You are young. If  age > and equal 13 and age <18, print You are a teenager..Otherwise, print You are old..
