# HackerRank 30 Days Of Code Challenge
  

### Day 1: Data Types
#### For solving the first challenge I used JavaScript. But whatever language that you want you can use and solve it.   

### Day 2: Operators 
#### Task: Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer. For solving the problem I used JS as day 1.
