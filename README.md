# HackerRank 30 Days Of Code Challenge
  

### Day 1: Data Types
#### For solving the first challenge I used JavaScript. But whatever language that you want you can use and solve it.   

 
### Day 2: Operators 
#### Task: Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer. For solving the problem I used JS as day 1.


### Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements
#### /* Task Given an integer,N, perform the following conditional actions: If N is odd, print Weird If N is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird If N is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird If N is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.
